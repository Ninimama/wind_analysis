## Wind analysis in Province of Alberta

This repo provides an insight into the wind power generation in Alberta. It includes the following files:
- Plot_windfarms: plot 20 windfarms on the map of Alberta
- Playing with data and plots: plot histograms of operation, pairwise distance and correlation, etc  
- Average monthly wind power of each wind farms during last years
- Find frequency of a few predefined interesting patterns: For a few pre-defined patterns, it calculated their frequency
- Find most frequent motifs: Calculates what are the most frequent pattern (motif) in all time, without knowing the patterns in advance
- frequency_of_gen_events: The probabilty of different high and low persistent generation
- Analysis of Cross-Windfarms-Clustered: Clustering windfarms into 5 groups and anlysing their interactions.



**The plotted results are not based on the real values**
